                    <h3>A comparative study on indian food nutrition profile & foreign ones.</h3>
                    <p>India is faced with a severe issue in the scenario of malnutrition and diet-related non-communicable diseases (DR-NCDs). In the present study, nutritional quality of 77 foods from around the globe, including 36 Indian staple foods, is evaluated with 12 significant nutrient variables. Advanced statistical tools, such as clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and radar plots, are utilized for Indian vs. global dietary pattern comparison. The results are such that Indian food is significantly different (p = 0.0016), which is especially higher in energy density with less protein per calorie. Inadequacies of iron, folate, and vitamin C are frequent results in the present study, which are responsible for the high prevalence of anaemia and metabolic disease in India. Interestingly, no significant value in vitamin C content was observed in South Indian foods. Cooking practices and typical nutritional fallacies also hamper the nutrient retention. This study highlights the need for immediate dietary modification as well as for better public awareness about nutritional balance in India..</p>

                    <h3>Biotechnology 101</h3>
                    <p>Genetic engineering involves the manipulation of genetic material, specifically DNA, to achieve desired products or results in a pre-determined way. Some terms frequently used to address this field include gene manipulation, recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology, gene cloning (molecular cloning), genetic modifications, and new genetics. The foundation of modern rDNA technology was laid by Boyer and Cohen in 1973, who successfully recombined two plasmids (pSC101 and pSC102) and cloned the new plasmid in E. coli. Their experiments demonstrated the successful transplantation and expression of frog genes in E. coli, marking the beginning of modern molecular biotechnology. Some biotechnologists categorize the field chronologically as Before Boyer and Cohen (BBC) and After Boyer and Cohen (ABC) biotechnology.</p>
